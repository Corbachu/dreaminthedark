AITD_PakEdit v0.04
==================

https://github.com/jmimu/FITD/tree/master/AITD_PakEdit


Alone in the Dark PakEdit allows to modify PAK file for AITD and FITD.
It is based on yaz0r's FITD PAK reading implementation, and using original PKZip 1.1 compressor.

Automatic cross compilation from linux
--------------------------------------
docker pull crossqt1804
docker run --rm --device /dev/fuse --privileged -v $(pwd)/..:/src crossqt1804 /src/AITD_PakEdit/compile_all.sh

Getting Started
---------------
Copy io_alone/ to bender/2.9x/scripts/addons/

Make a copy of your original PAK files.

Run AITD_PakEdit.
Open a database corresponding to the game (AITD1_PAK_DB.json for AITD1).
Open a PAK.

You see every file in the PAK, with there description and type from the database.
You can modify them and overwrite database (and send it to me for next release!).
When selecting a file, you can export it depending of its type.
For now you can export raw files (just decompressed), pictures, texts,
palettes+pictures, sound samples and floors (not finalized).
For now only pictures, texts, sound samples and raw files can be re-imported.
You can then modify the exported files, and re-import them.
Overwrite the PAK file (a .PAK.BAK file will be created to save previous version).
Run the game with the new PAK.

To be able to re-import compressed files (mandatory for bodies), you have
to install Dosbox emulator and set dosbox executable path (if it is not in system's PATH).
You also have to get PKZip 1.1 executable

Floors are exported in Collada format.
You can open it with meshlab or blender.
To have a correct superposition with the background images, you must
stretch them into 320*240 or set blender's output Y aspect to 1.2.
Objects names are : type_rX_tY_pZ, where X is room number, Y type and Z parameter.
You have to change those names in order to change objects metadata.
